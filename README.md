# GraphEngine
ColdFusion code for creating a graph/chart
This is based on a simple graph I created using DIV tags and ColdFusion combined with a database query.
Basically I create bar charts with a div width (or height) depending on the % for each graph (database) value
You can achieve this with CFCHART or others, but this is a simple code base.
